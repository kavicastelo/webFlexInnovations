      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>At FlexiArt, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal
        information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you
        interact with our website or contact us for projects. Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy to
        understand our practices and how your information is handled.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Information We Collect</li>
        <p>When you visit our website, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you
          choose to provide it to us voluntarily. However, we may collect certain non-personal information such as your
          IP address and browsing behavior to improve our website and enhance your user experience.</p>
        <p>When you provide feedback to us, we may collect your name and email address in order to respond to your
          feedback or inquiries. Similarly, when you contact us to discuss potential projects, we may collect your name,
          email address, telephone number, and address to communicate with you and provide the services you require.
          This information is used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your requests and providing you with the best
          possible service.</p>

        <li>Use of Personal Information</li>
        <p>The personal information we collect is used to communicate with you, respond to your inquiries, and provide
          the services you request. We may also use your email address to send you updates about our company, new
          features, or promotional offers, but only if you have explicitly consented to receive such communications. You
          can opt-out of these communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the
          email or by contacting us directly.</p>

        <li>Disclosure of Personal Information</li>
        <p>At FlexiArt, we do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may, however,
          share your personal information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our
          business, such as hosting providers, email service providers, or analytics tools. These third-party providers
          are contractually bound to keep your information confidential and are prohibited from using your personal
          information for any other purpose.</p>

        <li>Protection of Personal Information</li>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration, or destruction. We employ industry-standard security measures, including encryption, to ensure the
          confidentiality and integrity of your personal information. However, please note that no method of
          transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
          security.</p>

        <li>Data Retention</li>
        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
          this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When your personal
          information is no longer needed, we will securely dispose of it in accordance with applicable laws and
          regulations.</p>

        <li>Children's Privacy</li>
        <p>Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with
          personal information, please contact us, and we will promptly delete the information from our records.</p>

        <li>Changes to this Privacy Policy</li>
        <p>FlexiArt reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes we make will be
          posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
